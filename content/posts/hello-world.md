Welcome to my blog! This is my first post, written in Obsidian and published via Hugo.

## About this setup

I write posts in Obsidian, which syncs to my Hugo site. When I push to GitHub, the blog automatically rebuilds and deploys.

This workflow gives me:
- The comfort of writing in Obsidian
- The speed of a static site
- Automatic deployments on git push

The full workflow is now complete.
